#  Sweet Shop Management System


The **Sweet Shop Management System** is a console-based application designed to digitize the manual operations of a retail sweet shop. Traditional ledger-keeping is prone to human error, data redundancy, and lack of insights.

This project solves these issues by providing a centralized platform to:
* Maintain an accurate inventory of sweets, prices, and stock levels.
* Process customer purchases and generate digital bill records.
* Analyze business performance through visual graphs.

It utilizes **Pandas** for high-performance data manipulation (CRUD operations) and **Matplotlib** for data visualization, making it a perfect example of applied data handling in Python.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Inventory Control (CRUD)
* **Add Stock:** Seamlessly add new sweet varieties with details like Cost, Quantity, and Ingredients.
* **Update Records:** Modify price or quantity as market rates fluctuate.
* **Remove Items:** Delete outdated or discontinued items from the database.

### 2. Smart Search
* Query the database using a unique **Sweet Code** to instantly retrieve specific product details without scrolling through the entire list.

### 3. Automated Billing System
* Calculates the total amount based on quantity and unit price.
* **Auto-Stock Reduction:** Automatically deducts the sold quantity from the main inventory to prevent stock mismatch.
* Generates a unique Bill ID for every transaction.

### 4. Data Visualization
* **Price Analysis:** A bar chart comparing the cost/kg of different sweets.
* **Sales Report:** A visual representation of total sales generated by different customers.

### 5. Persistent Storage
* All data is stored in **CSV files** (`sweets.csv` and `customer.csv`). This ensures that data remains intact even after the application is closed and restarted.
